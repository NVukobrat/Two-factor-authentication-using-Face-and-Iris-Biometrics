Face:
- Loading candidate data
- Extract mean eigeinface
    - Normalize extracted eigenfaces because some data can be low quality.
    - Also you need to sort eigenvactors and eigenvalues so the normalization.
    - Intruduction of thechnique of dinamic threshold determination.
    step can be done correctly.
    - Show mean face for all faces
    - Computes difference vector
    - Show difference vector
    - Why covariance matrix, show it
    - Explain eig() MatLab function, how does
        - Eigenvector represent the main points in image that
        just streach, while the eigenvalues represents the scalar
        of that vector.
    it extract eigenvalues and eigenvectors? What
    are they?
    - Why sorting Vectors and Values
    - How candidate eigenface is computed?
    - Mean eigenface computation?
    - Scaling mean eigenface? Yes or no? Explain and show.
    - Compute mean eigenface for all candidates? Why?
- Extract candidate eigenfaces
- Calculate precision? What is RMSE?
    - Why RMSE?
    - Error rate between candidate faces.
        - In 'error_rate_between_candidate_and_mean_eigenface_scaled' file is 
        represented RMSE between all candidate SCALED faces and their eigenfaces.
        - In 'error_rate_between_candidate_and_mean_eigenface' file is 
        represented RMSE between all candidate NOT SCALED faces and their eigenfaces.
    - Error rate between candidate and intruder faces?
        - In 'one_vs_all_scaled_error_rate' file is represented RMSE between
        current candidate eigenface and all candidate faces in SCALED form. 
        Each column represents one candidate mean eigenface, while rows 
        represents every candidate face.
        - In 'one_vs_all_error_rate' -||- in NOT SCALED -||-.
- Calculate precision using Euclidean distance.
    - Why euclidean error rates are decreasing in 'euclidean_error_rate' function
    in 'error_rate' vector?
- Compare results from RMSE and Euclidean mesurments.
    - Results are almoust same.
- Calculate precision for each vector number.
