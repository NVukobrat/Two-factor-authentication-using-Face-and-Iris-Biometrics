- Two irises of same person are not same.
- In this dataset some persons dont have both left and right eye images, so
I will use right images by default, and left only if there isn't any image
of right eye.
- Reading eye images of candidates in simular way as faces. Final results are
represented in cell form of row vector. Each column represents one candidate.
Every candidate cell consists of right or left images of that candidate which 
are structed in this way:
    - Each row represents one eye image of candidate in row vector form.
- Extraction of vertical edges, not with Canny.
- When extract features from multiple iris of one person, what then? To mearge
all of that irises as for eagan face, or to use one particular eye image?
- Sigma and Thresh brute force testing in Canny edgde detection.
- Need add_circle function explanation.
- Can I write my paper in form on research work, or it needs to be in form that
VISER has?
- To use all photos of candidate Iris, I can calculate distance between each
candidate iris and delete thoes which had to large distance between rest of 
candidate irises. By this method I can remove low quality irises thoes on which
algorith done bad boundary extraction.
- Did Masek use Canny edge detector? Canny doesnt extract vertical or horizontal
edges, just both.
- Increse lumince, shadows, colors to see beter boundaries of iris.
- Dynamic thresh for each candidate
- Explination of finding eyelid lines
- Line detector doesnt detect eyelashes, it detects eyelids.
- When i write image as variable it displeys chield??
